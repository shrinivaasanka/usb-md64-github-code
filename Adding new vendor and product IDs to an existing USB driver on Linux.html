	      Frequently, when a USB device doesn't work out of the
	      box with Linux, it turns out that there already is a
	      driver which can handle the device. All that must be
  	      done is to make the driver recognize the device.
	      Unfortunately, it is widely believed that you have to build your own
	      kernel to fix this.
            </p>
            <p>
	    But from kernel version 2.6.21 (2007), all
	    USB drivers can be told to recognize an additional device
	    without rebuilding. Support for USB serial drivers came
	    last, other USB drivers got  this capability with
	      2.6.16 (2006).
            </p>
            <blockquote class="note">
	      To tell which kernel version you are running, give this
	      command in a terminal window:
	    <pre>uname -r</pre>
	      My Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat) answers '2.6.35-22-generic, which is a
	      variant of the 2.6.35 kernel version.

	      Imagine that you've just unpacked your brand new
	      Yoyodyne USB frobitzer. You've plugged it into your
	      computer, but it didn't work. You have googled, and
	      found that 'foo_driver' is reported to handle an earlier
	      model of the same device.</p>
	    <p>
	      Give this command in a terminal window:
	    <pre>lsusb</pre>
	    You'll see a number of lines looking more or less like this:
	    <pre>Bus 003 Device 002: ID 34ca:d365 Yoyodyne Electronics Frobitzer</pre>
	    It's easy to tell which line belongs to your device: It
	    disappears when you unplug it. You need the text strings '34ca'
	    and 'd365'. '34ca' is called the vendor ID, and 'd365' the
	    product ID. The kernel uses these when
	    choosing a driver.
	    <p>If you see 'command not found' when you give the
	    'lsusb' command, you have to install the 'usbutils' package.</p>
	    
	    Here's what you do:
	      <ul>
		<li>Unplug the device. I think this only is necessary
		if another driver has recognized the device, but is
		handling it poorly. But it can't hurt in any case.
		<li>Become root in a terminal window.
		<li>Give the commands:
		
		<pre>modprobe foo_driver
echo 34ca d365 > /sys/bus/usb/drivers/foo_driver/new_id</pre>

		USB serial drivers are typically used with devices
		like cell phone cables, cellular modems, bluetooth
		adapters, etc. If this is a USB serial device, the command sequence becomes

		<pre>modprobe foo_driver
echo 34ca d365 > /sys/bus/usb-serial/drivers/foo_driver/new_id</pre>
		
		<li>Plug in the device.
	      </ul>
	    <p>
	      Replace 'foo_driver' and the IDs with your actual driver,
	      vendor ID and product ID.
	    </p>
            <p>
              'new_id' does not work with 'usbserial', the
	      generic driver. But this is not really a problem. Although
	      there is lot of advice on the net that you
	      should use the generic driver, it is actually only for
	      testing. Although your device may work after a fashion
	      with the generic driver, there is almost always a better
	      solution.
            </p>
	    <p>
	      What if you have to add two different IDs to the same
	      driver? Then you do it with two echo statements, like
	      this:
	      <pre>echo 34ca d365 > /sys/bus/usb/drivers/foo_driver/new_id
echo 1cc2 5299 > /sys/bus/usb/drivers/foo_driver/new_id</pre>			      
	      Adding IDs only works if the kernel has been built with
	      CONFIG_HOTPLUG enabled. Almost all current distributions
	      turn this feature on.

	      <h2>Hotplugging with udev</h2>
	      <!-- Based on -->
	      <!-- http://andy.hillhome.org/blog/2007/02/05/using-a-umts-card-on-opensuse-102/ -->
	      <p>
	      You can create a <em>udev</em> rule to make the device
	      "just work" when it is plugged in. The following hasn't
	      been tested, but should be close:
	      </p>
	      <p>
	      Create /etc/udev/rules.d/95-foo.rules containing the
	      following:
	      
	      <pre># Rules for hotplugging Yoyodyne USB frobitzers
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="34ca", SYSFS{idProduct}=="d365", RUN="/etc/yoyodyne_foo.sh"
# You may need lines like these to create devices with correct groups
# and permissions, and set up symlinks:
# KERNEL=="ttyUSB0", SYMLINK="modem", GROUP="dialout", MODE="0660"
# KERNEL=="ttyUSB1", GROUP="dialout" MODE="0660"</pre>
	      
	      and /etc/yoyodyne_foo.sh as follows:
	      <pre>#!/bin/sh
modprobe foo_driver
echo 34ca d365 > /sys/bus/usb/drivers/foo_driver/new_id</pre>

	      Change these files to suit your situation. And please
	      report bugs.
